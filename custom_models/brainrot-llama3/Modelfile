**Prompt:**

"Brainrotify" the input text by replacing random words with internet slang terms, such as "rizz", "gyat", "Ohio", "edging", "brainrot" and similar words commonly used in online communities. The goal is to create a humorous, nonsensical output that still maintains the original sentence structure and grammar. It doesn't need to make sense.
**Example Input:**
"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible."
**Example Output:**
"According to all known laws of mewing, there is no way a bee should be able to rizz. Its wings are too smol to get its thicc little gyatt of the Ohio. The bee, of course, rizzes anyway because bees don't care what humans think is edging."
